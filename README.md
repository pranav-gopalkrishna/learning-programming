# About
Programming is the practice of creating computer programs by writing, organising and integrating algorithms in a form that can be converted into machine-readable code. A programming language is a formal system consisting of a set of rules (syntax) for writing such programs, and associated tools like compilers, interpreters, or development environments to translate and execute the code. These tools facilitate the conversion of high-level human-readable code into low-level machine code. If a set of rules and standards is not supported by translation tools, it is termed pseudocode, which, while potentially useful for human understanding and algorithm presentation, is not a programming language since it cannot be executed by a machine.

_This repository contains learnings about a few such languages._
